 <b>OCR input of MH crisis assessments</b> <br>
<p>Client presented with 54 months of printed mental health crisis assessments that need(ed) to be analyzed for diagnostic significance. This consisted of 18 three-inch, 3-ring binders of printed materials that needed to be converted into machine-readable format.</p>
<p>I scanned the documents into *.tif files, a loss-less graphical image format. Each month of data consisted of approximately 75 to 80 records. I scanned the files in batches of twenty records and employed split_tiff.py to separate the multipage TIFF file into individual files. </p>
